# Filter-Map-Reduce


## Filter

Filter is core function that allows you to process your data and select 
elements that meet a certain predicate.

```clojure
(filter even? [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])
; => (2 4 6 8 10)
```

Filter always takes a predicate and sequence of data and produces a 
new list with the same or fewer elements after the filter has been applied.



## Map

Map transform a sequence of data by applying a function to each element 
of it. Map produces a new list with the transformed items.

```clojure
(map #(* 100 %) [1 2 3])
; => (100 200 300)
```

Itâ€™s possible to have multiple collections that map to each other:

```clojure
(map + [1 2 3] [100 100 100])
; => (101 102 103)
```

Map returns a list with the same number of elements that is given to it, 
it has the same number of inputs to outputs.



## Reduce

Reduce reduces a sequence of data into a single result by applying a 
function on it.

```clojure
(reduce + [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])
; => 55
```

It takes the first two items in the list, applies the function to them, 
then takes that result along with the next item in the list and applies
the function to them and so on.

There are two different types of reduce in Venice, one that takes an 
initial starting argument and one that takes no starting value and 
applies the function to the starting values in the list.

One with no starting value:

```clojure
(reduce + [1 2 3])
; => 6
```

One with a starting value:

```clojure
(reduce + 6 [1 2 3])
; => 12
```



## Combine Filter-Map-Reduce

Filter, map and reduce are often combined for processing lists of data.

```clojure
(reduce + (map #(+ 10 %) (filter even? [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8])))
; => 60
```

The thread last macro `->>` converts nested function calls into a linear 
flow of function calls, improving readability.

```clojure
(->> [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
  (filter even?)
  (map #(+ 10 %))
  (reduce +))
; => 60
```
